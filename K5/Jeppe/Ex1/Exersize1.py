# Exercise 1

# Use the biker.png template from Exercise materials to do mean shift tracking in the traffic video in Exercise materials. (Hint: use OpenCV's calcBackProject() function to produce a similarity image for mean shift - see this mean shift tutorial for more pointers)
# Note that for mean shift tracking you need to provide an initial tracking window manually, and the biker only shows up from frame 114, so wait until then to start tracking.
# What happens when the biker disappears over the horizon? Why?
